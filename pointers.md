#  Pointers in C – Explained Step-by-Step

---

## 1. Start with the Definition

 “In C, a **pointer** is a variable that stores the **memory address** of another variable.  


---

## 2. Show the Syntax

```c
int a = 10;
int *ptr = &a;
```

###  Explanation:

- `int` → data type of the variable `a`.
- `*ptr` → declares a pointer to an `int`.
- `&a` → gives the memory address of `a`, which is stored in `ptr`.

---

## 3. Talk About the Operators

| Operator | Meaning                                 |
|----------|------------------------------------------|
| `*`      | Pointer declaration or **dereferencing** |
| `&`      | Address-of operator (gets memory address)|

---

##  4. Explain with a Memory Example

```c
int a = 5;
int *p = &a;
```

### Imagine:

- `a` is stored at address `0x1000`
- `p` holds `0x1000` (the address of `a`)
- `*p` gives the value at that address → `5`

### So:

```c
printf("%d", *p);  // outputs 5
```

---

##  5. Show a Real Code Example

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int a = 10;
    int *p = &a;

    printf("Value of a: %d\n", a);
    printf("Address of a: %p\n", &a);
    printf("Value stored in pointer p: %p\n", p);
    printf("Value pointed to by p: %d\n", *p);

    return 0;
}
```

---

 Output Example (format may vary depending on system):

```
Value of a: 10
Address of a: 0x7ffee914c69c
Value stored in pointer p: 0x7ffee914c69c
Value pointed to by p: 10
```

#### What Is a String in C?
A string in C is an array of characters ending with a null character ''.
 C does not have a built-in string type like Python or Java.
Example
```c
char str[] = "hello";
This is internally:
['h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', '\0']
```
#### What Is a String Pointer?
A string pointer is a pointer that points to a character array (a string).
```c
char *str = "hello";
```
	"hello" is a string literal stored in read-only memory
	str points to the first character 'h'
 You should not modify string literals. This is undefined behavior.
#### Declaring String Pointers
1. Using Character Array (modifiable)
```c
char str[] = "hello";
```
2. Using Pointer (read-only)
```c
char *str = "hello";
```
#### Example: Accessing Characters via Pointer
```c
char *str = "hello";

printf("%c\n", str[0]);      // Output: h
printf("%c\n", *(str + 1));  // Output: e
```
#### Pointer to Array of Strings
Declaration
```c
char *words[] = { "one", "two", "three" };
```
words is an array of string pointers
Each words[i] is a char* pointing to a string
#### Example
```c
printf("%s\n", words[1]);  // Output: two
```
#### Memory Layout of char *words[]
words[0] ───→ "one"   → ['o', 'n', 'e', '\0']
words[1] ───→ "two"   → ['t', 'w', 'o', '\0']
words[2] ───→ "three" → ['t', 'h', 'r', 'e', 'e', '\0']
#### Difference Between Static Array and Pointer
```c
	char str[] = "abc";	char *str = "abc";
```
Memory	Stack	Read-only data section
Allocated at	Compile time	Compile time
#### Dynamic String Allocation with malloc()
When the string size is not known at compile time, use malloc():
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
    int n;
    printf("Enter length: ");
    scanf("%d", &n);

    char *str = (char *)malloc(n * sizeof(char));
    if (str == NULL) {
        printf("Memory allocation failed.\n");
        return 1;
    }

    printf("Enter string: ");
    scanf("%s", str);

    printf("You entered: %s\n", str);
    free(str);
    return 0;
}
```
#### Resize String at Runtime using realloc()
```c
str = realloc(str, new_size * sizeof(char));
```
•	Works only with memory allocated by malloc()
•	 Cannot be used with static arrays like char str[100];
#### Common Mistakes
Mistake	Why it’s wrong
```c
char *str = "hello"; 
str[0] = 'H';	
```
Modifying read-only memory
```c
char str[5]; 
scanf("%s", str);	
```
No boundary check → buffer overflow
